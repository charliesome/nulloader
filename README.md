# Welcome to nulloader
Nulloader is an open source plugin loader and framework for [Nullular Grapher](http://nullular.com/grapher).

## Getting Started
Just download the latest as a [**zip**](http://github.com/charliesome/nulloader/zipball/master) or [**tar**](http://github.com/charliesome/nulloader/tarball/master) archive (however the technically minded here can always `git pull` it down)

Extract everything in `nulloader\bin\Release` to your Nullular Grapher install folder and launch `nulloader.exe` everytime you wish to launch Nullular Grapher

## Contributing
I need people to help me with this project. Whether you just want to develop a handy plugin, or you're interested in extending the framework, just fork this project and have a poke around the source to get familiarized.

If there's anything you need help with, or if you've found a bug, feel free to [file an issue report](http://github.com/charliesome/nulloader/issues) or even fix it yourself if you're game enough :p

## Known Issues

* Nullular Grapher crashes whenever system dialogs are opened. This is caused by the cross-thread interaction from nulloader.
** If anyone knows anything about this kinda stuff, can you please fork this and fix it? Thanks :)
